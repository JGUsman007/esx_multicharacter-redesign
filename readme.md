A Simplistic system, that allows Players to have multiple Characters, which can be customised for all player with `Config.Slots` or personally set a players character count using `setslots`, `remslots`, `enablechar` and `disablechar` Commands :)

## Notes

- Characters are stored in the users table as `char#:license`
- Character deletion does not require manual entries for the tables to remove
